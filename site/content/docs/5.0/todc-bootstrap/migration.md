## Summary

## By component

This list highlights key changes by component between v3.x.x and v4.0.0.

### Breaking

### Buttons

  - Flat buttons
    - The optional `.btn-flat` modifier class has been removed.

### Navs

  - Tabs
    - `.nav-tabs-google` has been eliminated. This was done because we are no
      maintaining two tab styles. The default Bootstrap style tab is gone.

### Navbar

  - Navbar Sizes
    - `.navbar-masthead` has been replaced by `.navbar-lg`.
    - `.navbar-sm` is the size of the old the `.navbar`.
    - `.navbar-toolbar` has been removed. The new mid size navbar is `.navbar`.
